# Understanding routes

What is a route.... reference the naming conventions in Ember  template/route/controller


## What is a route?


## Where is the application route? Why did you hide if from me?

Good question!


## Creating routes

`ember generate route [[desired-route-name]]`

`ember generate route parent-route-name/child-route-name`

note: What is the accepted {{insert here}} type syntax to be sure it is clear?


## Resources

List of resources for situations

See the example in the 'application' controller that was explicitly created with the CLI for this project - and how it backs the template / controls logic etc...


## Other info...

Will controller go away - and could we just have a little hash in the route to do this job? What is the problem with controllers - if there is one? Are there situations that aren't 'cool'?

NOTE: about the 'not scrolling to the top of a long page on route change' situation

[There could be community-generated videos for each of these topics]
